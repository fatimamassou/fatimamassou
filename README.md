 I’m a curious full-stack developer student with 2+ years of hands-on experience ≈ building, breaking, and learning every day!
I code both front and back (because why choose?) with love for clean UI, smooth animations, and smart logic.
From HTML & CSS to PHP, JavaScript, Python, MySQL, jQuery, AJAX, Laravel, and even a sprinkle of machine learning ≈ I’m always leveling up!
I love bringing ideas to life with interactive designs, responsive layouts, and a touch of ✨magic✨.
Currently exploring: TypeScript, Tailwind, React, and all things beautiful in code.
Forever learning. Forever building.
